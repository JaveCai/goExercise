Exercise 9.1: Add a function Withdraw(amount int) bool to the gopl.io/ch9/bank1
program. The result should indicate whether the transaction succeeded or failed due to insuf-
Ô¨Åcient funds.The message sent to the monitor goroutine must contain both the amount to
withdraw and a new channel over which the monitor goroutine can send the boolean result
back to Withdraw.
